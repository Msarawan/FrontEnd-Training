                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides 
                HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>

                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.
                CSS helps us to control the text color, font style, the spacing between paragraphs, sizing of columns, layout designs, and many more. It is independent of HTML,
                and we can use it with any XML-based markup language. It is recommended to use CSS because the HTML attributes are being deprecated.

          <p>According to the Java platform official website, the main difference between Java and JavaScript is that Java is an OOP programming language while JavaScript is an
